Display a laser interference pattern (speckle pattern)
Use a grid arrangement with the characteristic green laser light.

This simulates a Laser pointer whose beam passes through a set of diffraction gratings.
When you shine a laser pointer (green, 532nm wavelength) through a transmission diffraction grating, you get s beautiful regular array of bright spots.
The center spot is the zero-order (undiffracted beam), and the surrounding spots are the various diffraction orders.
The symmetry and regularity of the pattern is due to the relative angles of the diffraction gratings.
Laser transmitted through a diffraction grating filter.
(A similar principle coul duse a reflection instead of transmission grating.)
This could be used as a demonstration setup for physics education, teaching about wave optics, interference, and diffraction.

Note:
- The center spot is brightest (zero-order maximum)
- There's good symmetry in the pattern
- The spots gradually dim as you move away from center
- The spots are green (characteristic of common 532nm DPSS laser pointers)

A green laser pointer shining through a diffraction grating onto a screen or wall.
This is a classic physics demonstration that beautifully illustrates the wave nature of light and the principles of diffraction.
